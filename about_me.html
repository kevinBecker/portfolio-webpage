                    <p>
                        I am a multidisciplinary engineer specializing in automation, robotics, and marine systems. My experience includes control theory, 
                        automation, CAD design, robotics, and data analysis, with a particular focus on autonomous underwater vehicles and marine systems.

                    <h2>Education</h2>
                    <p>
                        I earned my dual B.S. in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering from 
                        <a href="https://www.webb.edu">Webb Institute</a>, one of the world's most unique engineering institutions. 
                        Subsequently, I completed my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering at MIT, where I served as a graduate research assistant 
                        in the <a href="https://oceanai.mit.edu/pavlab/pmwiki/pmwiki.php">Marine Autonomy Lab</a>, focusing on computer science, 
                        autonomy, control systems, and simulation.
