                    <p>
                        I received a B.S. from 
                        <a href="https://www.webb.edu">Webb Institute</a>
                        in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering. My undergraduate senior thesis involved improving waypoint navigation and user interface of an unmanned surface vehicle. Read about it on the <a href="projects.html"> projects</a> page!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I then got my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from MIT, 
                        working as a graduate research assistant in the <a href="https://oceanai.mit.edu/pavlab/pmwiki/pmwiki.php">Marine Autonomy Lab</a>, focusing on autonomy, control, and simulation.

                    <h3>SAAB Inc Autonomous Undersea Division (June 2024) (Full-Time)</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am currently a systems engineer at Saab inc. I have been working on a long-range AUV, file management automation, seakeeping analysis (and automation of the analysis pipeline), and more. I am also the technical lead on a low-cost Micro-UUV platform for the Navy. I have also participated in the company's AI learning initative. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>NATO STO CMRE (Jan-Feb 2022) (Internship)</h3>
                    <p>
                        I worked in their young scientist program, helping analyze their collaborative control engine and its cabability to estimate position errors. This is where I leaned a about in-depth the topics of acousitcs and autonomy paradigms can be. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>ThayerMahan (Jan-Feb 2021) (Internship)</h3>
                    <p>
                        I worked as an engineering intern designing many different unique systems. I worked on multiple fascets of in-house PCB prototyping technology (still in use as of Fall 2024), redesigning and 3D printing various components for a new platform, assisting with testing, and more. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Hydroid (Summer 2020) (Internship)</h3>
                    <p>
                        I worked as an intern at Huntingon Ingalls Mission Systems (formerly Hydroid) as an engineer on the Remus 300 platform. I focused my time on passive roll compensation, efficency gains, and control authority.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Key Lakes Shipping (Jan-March 2020) (Internship)</h3>
                    <p>
                        I worked as an engine room cadet for two months on the Arthur M Anderson steamship out of Toledo OH. I assisted with maintenance and ship upkeep for the two months onboard. As part of my undergraduate degree, I also traced out the steam plant in the engine room, learning about each pipe, where it goes, and how it improved the vessel's efficency and reliability.
                    </p>
                    <h3>NASSCO (Jan-Feb 2019) (Internship)</h3>
                    <p>
                        I worked at General Dynamics NASSCO for two months my freshman year as a shipyard intern. I learned about ship manufacturing and learned about welding, grinding, machinery installation, and much more.
