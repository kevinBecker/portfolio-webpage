                        I graduated from 
                        <a href="https://www.webb.edu">Webb Institute</a>, one of the most unique engineering schools in the world, 
                        with a dual B.S. in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering. I then obtained my 
                        M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from MIT, 
                        working as a graduate research assistant in the <a href="https://oceanai.mit.edu/pavlab/pmwiki/pmwiki.php">Marine Autonomy Lab</a>, focusing on autonomy, control, and simulation.
