                <h3><a>Vehicle Propagation Model.</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Consider a wide open sea where multiple sensors on different platforms are recieving spuradic detections of an unknown vessel on the water.
                    The goal of this method was to utilize a discrete approach, which compared to a particle based approach would:
                    1. Be repeatable, so the results are guaranteed to be the same for the same set of inputs.
                    2. A discrete approach would allow for all data to be transfered from one platform to another. This allows multiple searching vehicles to compare maps and gather data from each other. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few assumptions from this project are:
                </p><p>
                    1. The target exists.
                </p><p>
                    2. The target continued in a linear trajectory at the last known velocity/heading without turning.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The underlying method was to use the estimated heading/speed and its variance to generate a kernel to perform convolusions over the probability grid. This approach was inspired by a linearized hidden markov model.
                </p>
                <p>However, certain assumptions and constraints to the problem required discretization. The discretization resulted in numerical artifacts, yeilding poor results. However, it was an interesting learning experience.</p>
